This driver is functional but needs some cleanup before it is ready
for included in networking subsystem.

  - Use unifdef to elimiate non Linux code
  - Get rid of wrapper code including bsd_glue.h
  - Fix coding style to be Linux rather than BSD
  - Fix whitespace warnings
  - Add stubs so that ethernet drivers can use without #ifdef's
  - Autoload the module, assign a real minor number and have aliases
  - Rework documentation and put in Documentation/networking/
  - Remove memory allocator kludge wrapper
  - Remove devfs kludge wrappers
  - Review configuration API's and management (counters)
  - Locking should be consistent (ie get rid of separate_locks option)?
  - Doesn't work with DMA remapping
  - Use __u32 rather than uint32_t in headers
  - netmap_user.h headers should use inline instead of macros

Fundamentally this will break source compatiablity with FreeBSD,
but this is not our problem.
